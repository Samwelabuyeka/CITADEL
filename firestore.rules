/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Citadel Browser User Profiles
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles. Each user can only access their own profile data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All user profile data is stored under the `/users/{userId}` path, where `{userId}` corresponds to the Firebase Authentication UID.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only create, read, update, and delete their own profile.
 * - Listing all users is disallowed.
 * - The `id` field in the `UserProfile` document must match the `userId` in the path. This enforces path-based ownership and prevents users from impersonating others.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The `UserProfile` documents are designed to contain all the necessary information for authorization. No external lookups (e.g., `get()` calls) are required. The profile `id` MUST match the `userId` of the path.

     * @path /users/{userId}
     * @allow (create) - User with UID 'user_abc' creates a profile document with id: 'user_abc', googleId: 'google_abc', email: 'test@example.com', name: 'Test User'.
     * @allow (get) - User with UID 'user_abc' reads their own profile document.
     * @allow (update) - User with UID 'user_abc' updates their own profile document.
     * @allow (delete) - User with UID 'user_abc' deletes their own profile document.
     * @deny (create) - User with UID 'user_abc' attempts to create a profile document with id: 'user_xyz'.
     * @deny (get) - User with UID 'user_xyz' attempts to read the profile document of user 'user_abc'.
     * @deny (update) - User with UID 'user_xyz' attempts to update the profile document of user 'user_abc'.
     * @deny (delete) - User with UID 'user_xyz' attempts to delete the profile document of user 'user_abc'.
     * @principle Enforces document ownership for all operations and validates relational integrity between the path and the document's `id` field.
